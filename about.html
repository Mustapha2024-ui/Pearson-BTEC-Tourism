            <h2>The General Background of Kente</h2>
            <p>West Africa includes Benin, Burkina Faso, the Cape Verde Islands, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory
                Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sao
                Tome, Principe and Togo.</p>

            <p>Among the Ashanti people of West Africa, a popular legend relates how two young men learned the art of
                weaving by observing a spider weaving its web. One night, the two men went out into the forest to check
                their traps, and they were amazed by beautiful spiderâ€™s web who many unique designs sparkled in the
                moonlight. The men decided to learn how to weave the designs with a single thread, the men returned home
                to Bonwire, and their discovery was soon reported to Asantehene Osei Tutu, first ruler of the Ashanti
                Kingdom. The Asantehene adopted their creation, named kente, as a royal cloth reserved for special
                occasions</p>

            <p>Originally made from white cotton with some indigo patterning, kente cloth evolved when silk arrived with
                Portuguese traders in the 17th century. Fabric samples were pulled apart for the silken thread, which
                was then woven into the kente cloth. Later. when skeins of silk become available, more sophisticated
                patterns were created, although the high cost of silk meant they were only available to Akan royalty.
            </p>

            <p>The use of kente was reserved for Ashanti royalty and limited to special social and sacred functions.
                Even as production has increased and kente has become more accessible to those outside the royal court,
                it continues to be associated with wealth, high social status, and cultural sophistication. Patterns
                each have a name, as does each cloth. Names can be inspired by historical events, proverbs, concepts,
                literature, moral values, human and animal behavior, individual achievements, or even individuals in pop
                culture.
            </p>

            <p>Kente is more than just a cloth. It is an iconic visual representation of the history, philosophy,
                ethics, oral literature, religious beliefs, social values, and political thought of West Africa. Kente
                is one of the key symbols of Africa heritage and pride in African ancestry throughout the world.

                <h2>Ewe Kente Patterns</h2>
                <p>The Ewe Kente pattern, known for its bold colors and geometrical designs, often symbolizes strength
                    and resilience. Originating from the Ewe people of southeastern Ghana, these patterns are steeped in
                    history and cultural significance. Traditionally woven by skilled artisans using locally sourced
                    materials, each design tells a unique story, reflecting the community's values, beliefs, and
                    experiences. </p>

                <h2>Ashanti Kente Patterns</h2>
                <p>Characterized by more intricate patterns and a broader color palette, Ashanti Kente cloth represents
                    royal heritage and is often worn during significant ceremonies. Originating from the Ashanti Kingdom
                    in Ghana, these patterns are steeped in history and cultural significance. Each design is woven by
                    skilled artisans and conveys specific meanings related to social status, history, and moral values.
